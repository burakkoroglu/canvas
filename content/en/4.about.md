A few words about me

#intro
Hi, I’m Burak — a software developer focused on building scalable, efficient, and user-centered applications.
With solid experience in .NET, Vue.js, and Nuxt.js, I enjoy creating solutions that balance robust backend architectures with modern, elegant frontends.

Over the years, I’ve contributed to projects ranging from payment systems and enterprise applications to social platforms. I value clean code, thoughtful design, and collaboration, whether working within a team or independently.

Beyond client work, I constantly explore new technologies, improve my craft, and work on personal projects to expand my skill set. For me, software development is not just a profession — it’s an ongoing journey of curiosity, growth, and creativity.
